# Redis Cache

This is an example repository which comes with a preconfigured Redis Dockerfile
suitable for running a Redis cache in Render. It's based off of the official
Redis image (with Alpine Linux) but has a few configuration tweaks optimized for
Render as a cache.

A Redis cache is an example of a private service that can run on Render. [Create one on
Render](https://render.com/select-repo?type=pserv) with this repository.
